Cardboard Camera Passthrough Applications
==========================================

Two versions of the same idea - show a stereoscopic view of the camera to allow "Camera Passthrough" with Google cardboard. This allows for some interesting things like ARGs. The versions:

1. OpenGL version - since two cameras are not allowed to be showen simultaneously, this version creates a camera texture and shows it on two squares. It's not fish-eye stereoscopic but still looks ok and on my phone (Galaxy Nexus) it is a bit faster then carboard version.

2. Cardboard version - Uses the cardboard API. The "Right way" and shows fish-eye, but works slower and has a smaller POV on my phone.

Each of the versions also has a handy APK in case you don't want to compile it.
